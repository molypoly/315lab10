1. Which of the three algorithms performed the best for your pfile? Along with your statement of which algorithm did best, record only the 4-line summary information in lab10.txt.

    BestFit algorithm did the best 

    Using the best fit algorithm
	Total unserviced time is 69
	Total service required is 530
	Percent unserviced is 13%

2.


    - Increasing N has the effect of decreasing unserviced time.
    - Increasing MAXARRIVAL has the effect of increasing unserviced time.
    - Increasing MAXSIZE has the effect of increasing unserviced time.
    - Increasing MAXSERVICE has the effect of increasing unserviced time
